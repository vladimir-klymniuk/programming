    In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`, denoted by `n!`, is the `product` of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The factorial of `n` alsp equals the product of `n` with the next smaller factorial:

    n! = n * (n - 1) * (n -2) * (n - 3) * * * * * 3 * 2 * 1 = n * (n - 1)!

    For example, 
        5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 5 * 24 = 120.

    In mathematics, a product is the result of multiplication or an expression that identifies factors to be multiplied.
