## Tree Data Structure
```
    A tree is a nonlinear hierarchical data structure that
    consists of nodes connected by edges.

        1
       / \
      2   3
    / |
   4  5
    / | \
   6  7  8
```

## Why Tree Data Structure?
```
    Other data structures such as arrays, linked list, stack,
    and queue are linear data structures that store data sequentially. In order to perform any operation in a linear 
    data structure, the time complexity increases with the
    increase in the data size. But, it is not acceptable in
    today's computational world.

    Different tree data structures allow quicker and easier access
    to the data as it is a non-linear data structure.

## Tree Terminolofies

### Node
```
    A node is an entity that contains a key or value and pointers to it's child nodes.

    The last nodes of each path are called leaf nodes or `external nodes` that do not contain a link/pointer to child nodes.

    The node having at least a child node is called an `internal node`.
```

### Edge
```
    It is the link between any two nodes.

         1
        / \  --> Edge
       2   3 --> Node
      / \
     4   5
```

### Root
```
    It is the topmost node of a tree.
```

### Height of a Node
```
    The height of a node is the number of edges from the
    node to the deepest leaf (ie. the longest path from the 
    node to a leaf node).
```

### Depth of a Node
```
    The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root
    to the node.
```

### Height of a Tree
```
    The height of a Tree is the height of the root node or the 
    depth of the deepest node.
                    h = 2
                    d = 0
                   /     \
                h = 1   h = 0
                d = 0   d = 1
               /     \
            h = 0   h = 0
            d = 2   d = 2

```

### Degree of a Node
```
    The degree of a node is the total number of branches
    of that node.
```

### Forest
```
    A collection of disjoint trees is called a forest.

        1
       / \
      2   3     ->      2
     / \               / \
    4   5             4   5         3

        'Creating forest from a tree'
```
You can create a forest by cutting the root of a tree.

### Types of Tree
```
    - Binary Tree
    - Binary Search Tree
    - AVL Tree
    - B-Tree
```

### Tree Traversal
```
    In order to perform any operation on a tree, you need to
    reach to the specific node. The tree traversal algorithm
    helps in visiting a required node in the tree.
```

### Tree Applications
    - Binary Search Trees(BSTs) are used to quickly check
      whether an element is present in a set or not.
    - Heap is a kind of tree that is used for heap sort.
    - A modified version of a tree called Tries is used in
      modern routers to store routing information.
    - Most popular databases use B-Trees and T-Trees, which
      are variants of the tree structure we learned above to
      store their data
    - Compilers use a syntax tree to validate the syntax of
      every program you write.
